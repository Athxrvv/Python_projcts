# 🛡️ Bulletproof Web Scraper (Python)

A **self-validating web scraper** that not only scrapes data from a website but also **tests itself** to detect data quality issues and website structure changes automatically.

This project demonstrates **industry-style web scraping with automated testing**, data cleaning, and error detection.

- Scrapes product data
- Runs automated tests on scraped data
- Fails loudly if something breaks
